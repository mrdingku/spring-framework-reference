        <p>Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.</p>
        <p class="muted">스프링 프레임워크는 자바 애플리케이션 개발을 위해 포괄적인 인프라스트럭쳐를 제공하는 자바 플랫폼입니다. 당신의 애플리케이션에 집중할 수 있도록 스프링이 인프라를 핸들링합니다.</p>
		<p>Spring enables you to build applications from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming model and to full and partial Java EE.</p>
        <p class="muted">스프링은 "오래된 방식의 간단한 자바 오브젝트" (Plain Old Java Objects:POJOs)로 애플리케이션을 만들 수 있고 엔터프라이즈 서비스를 non-invasively으로 POJOs를 적용할 수 있습니다. 이 기능은 자바 SE 프로그래밍 모델과 전체 또는 부분적으로 자바 EE에 적용됩니다.</p>
		<p>Examples of how you, as an application developer, can use the Spring platform advantage:</p>

                <p>Java applications -- a loose term that runs the gamut from constrained applets to n-tier server-side enterprise applications -- typically consist of objects that collaborate to form the application proper. Thus the objects in an application have dependencies on each other.</p>

                <p>Although the Java platform provides a wealth of application development functionality, it lacks the means to organize the basic building blocks into a coherent whole, leaving that task to architects and developers. True, you can use design patterns such as Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Decorator, and Service Locator to compose the various classes and object instances that make up an application. However, these patterns are simply that: best practices given a name, with a description of what the pattern does, where to apply it, the problems it addresses, and so forth. Patterns are formalized best practices that you must implement yourself in your application.</p>

        <p>Dependency management and dependency injection are different things. To get those nice features of Spring into your application (like dependency injection) you need to assemble all the libraries needed (jar files) and get them onto your classpath at runtime, and possibly at compile time. These dependencies are not virtual components that are injected, but physical resources in a file system (typically). The process of dependency management involves locating those resources, storing them and adding them to classpaths. Dependencies can be direct (e.g. my application depends on Spring at runtime), or indirect (e.g. my application depends on <code class="code">commons-dbcp</code> which depends on <code class="code">commons-pool</code>). The indirect dependencies are also known as "transitive" and it is those dependencies that are hardest to identify and manage.</p>

        <p>If you are going to use Spring you need to get a copy of the jar libraries that comprise the pieces of Spring that you need. To make this easier Spring is packaged as a set of modules that separate the dependencies as much as possible, so for example if you don't want to write a web application you don't need the spring-web modules. To refer to Spring library modules in this guide we use a shorthand naming convention <code class="code">spring-*</code> or <code class="code">spring-*.jar,</code> where "*" represents the short name for the module (e.g. <code class="code">spring-core</code>, <code class="code">spring-webmvc</code>, <code class="code">spring-jms</code>, etc.). The actual jar file name that you use may be in this form (see below) or it may not, and normally it also has a version number in the file name (e.g. <code class="code">spring-core-3.0.0.RELEASE.jar</code>).</p>

        <p>So the first thing you need to decide is how to manage your dependencies: most people use an automated system like Maven or Ivy, but you can also do it manually by downloading all the jars yourself. When obtaining Spring with Maven or Ivy you have then to decide which place you'll get it from. In general, if you care about OSGi, use the EBR, since it houses OSGi compatible artifacts for all of Spring's dependencies, such as Hibernate and Freemarker. If OSGi does not matter to you, either place works, though there are some pros and cons between them. In general, pick one place or the other for your project; do not mix them. This is particularly important since EBR artifacts necessarily use a different naming convention than Maven Central artifacts.</p>

        <p>The mandatory logging dependency in Spring is the Jakarta Commons Logging API (JCL). We compile against JCL and we also make JCL <code class="classname">Log</code> objects visible for classes that extend the Spring Framework. It's important to users that all versions of Spring use the same logging library: migration is easy because backwards compatibility is preserved even with applications that extend Spring. The way we do this is to make one of the modules in Spring depend explicitly on <code class="code">commons-logging</code> (the canonical implementation of JCL), and then make all the other modules depend on that at compile time. If you are using Maven for example, and wondering where you picked up the dependency on <code class="code">commons-logging</code>, then it is from Spring and specifically from the central module called <code class="code">spring-core</code>.</p>

It has a runtime discovery algorithm that looks for other logging frameworks in well known places on the classpath and uses one that it thinks is appropriate (or you can tell it which one if you need to). If nothing else is available you get pretty nice looking logs just from the JDK (java.util.logging or JUL for short). You should find that your Spring application works and logs happily to the console out of the box in most situations, and that's important.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the runtime discovery algorithm in <code class="code">commons-logging</code>, while convenient for the end-user, is problematic. If we could turn back the clock and start Spring now as a new project it would use a different logging dependency. The first choice would probably be the Simple Logging Facade for Java (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.slf4j.org" target="_top">SLF4J</a>), which is also used by a lot of other tools that people use with Spring inside their applications.</p>

        <p>SLF4J is a cleaner dependency and more efficient at runtime than <code class="code">commons-logging</code> because it uses compile-time bindings instead of runtime discovery of the other logging frameworks it integrates. This also means that you have to be more explicit about what you want to happen at runtime, and declare it or configure it accordingly. SLF4J provides bindings to many common logging frameworks, so you can usually choose one that you already use, and bind to that for configuration and management.</p>

        <p>SLF4J provides bindings to many common logging frameworks, including JCL, and it also does the reverse: bridges between other logging frameworks and itself. So to use SLF4J with Spring you need to replace the <code class="code">commons-logging</code> dependency with the SLF4J-JCL bridge. Once you have done that then logging calls from within Spring will be translated into logging calls to the SLF4J API, so if other libraries in your application use that API, then you have a single place to configure and manage logging.</p>

        <p>A common choice might be to bridge Spring to SLF4J, and then provide explicit binding from SLF4J to Log4J. You need to supply 4 dependencies (and exclude the existing <code class="code">commons-logging</code>): the bridge, the SLF4J API, the binding to Log4J, and the Log4J implementation itself. In Maven you would do that like this</p>

        <p>That might seem like a lot of dependencies just to get some logging. Well it is, but it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> optional, and it should behave better than the vanilla <code class="code">commons-logging</code> with respect to classloader issues, notably if you are in a strict container like an OSGi platform.

        <p>A more common choice amongst SLF4J users, which uses fewer steps and generates fewer dependencies, is to bind directly to <a class="ulink" href="http://logback.qos.ch" target="_top">Logback</a>. This removes the extra binding step because Logback implements SLF4J directly, so you only need to depend on two libraries not four (<code class="code">jcl-over-slf4j</code> and <code class="code">logback</code>). If you do that you might also need to exclude the slf4j-api dependency from other external dependencies (not Spring), because you only want one version of that API on the classpath.</p>

        <p>Many people run their Spring applications in a container that itself provides an implementation of JCL. IBM Websphere Application Server (WAS) is the archetype.

This often causes problems, and unfortunately there is no silver bullet solution; simply excluding <code class="code">commons-logging</code> from your application is not enough in most situations.</p>
        <p>To be clear about this: the problems reported are usually not with JCL per se, or even with <code class="code">commons-logging</code>: rather they are to do with binding <code class="code">commons-logging</code> to another framework (often Log4J). This can fail because <code class="code">commons-logging</code> changed the way they do the runtime discovery in between the older versions (1.0) found in some containers and the modern versions that most people use now (1.1). Spring does not use any unusual parts of the JCL API, so nothing breaks there, but as soon as Spring or your application tries to do any logging you can find that the bindings to Log4J are not working.</p>

        <p>In such cases with WAS the easiest thing to do is to invert the class loader hierarchy (IBM calls it "parent last") so that the application controls the JCL dependency, not the container. That option isn't always open, but there are plenty of other suggestions in the public domain for alternative approaches, and your mileage may vary depending on the exact version and feature set of the container.</p>
